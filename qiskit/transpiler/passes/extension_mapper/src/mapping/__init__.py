"""This package contains functionality for determining placement of gates onto architectures.

A mapper is, in general, an algorithm that takes in a circuit and a current mapping of qubits
to the architecture and produces a new mapping that allows at least some gates of the circuit
to be performed after the mapping is implemented."""
